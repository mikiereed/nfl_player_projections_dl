test different number of previous years
test multitask vs individual
test gpu vs cpu
add more predictive catagories (targets, rushing attempts, etc)
test with just rushing, just passing, just receiveing (may fix normalization by getting rid of zeros)
test normalization
test auxilary task
try different eval metrics
Only send in non-zero statistics
Break apart mse and check individual
Check feature importance


future
get ages
get coaches/teams
use auxilary tasks

pros
only one model with multitask

cons
longer training time
