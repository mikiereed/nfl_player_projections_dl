# test different number of previous years
# test multitask vs individual
# test normalization
# Break apart mse and check individual

pros
only one model with multitask

cons
longer training time

future
get more data (up to 2023)
get ages
get coaches/teams
test with just rushing, just passing, just receiveing (may fix normalization by getting rid of zeros)
Only send in non-zero statistics
"Feature selection is instance-wise, e.g. it can be different for each row of the training dataset"
use auxilary tasks
play with pretraining hyperparams
play with training params
try different eval metrics
Check feature importance
"Above design choices allows TabNet to enable two kinds of interpretability: local interpretability that visualises the importance of features and how they are combined for a single row, and global interpretability which quantifies the contribution of each feature to the trained model across the dataset."
add more predictive catagories (targets, rushing attempts, etc)
